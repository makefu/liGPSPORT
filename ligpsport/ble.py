"""Real BLE transport built on `bleak <https://bleak.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The BleakTransport opens a GATT connection to the BSC200, locates the
primary Nordic-UART service by UUID, subscribes to TX notifications,
and reassembles incoming MTU-sized chunks into whole framing-layer
frames using the ``payload_size`` field from the 20-byte header.

Outgoing frames are split into MTU-sized chunks the BLE stack can
write in one operation. The BSC200 negotiates an MTU during connect
that is normally well above the typical 23-byte default; the
transport caches the negotiated value and chunks accordingly.

Lifecycle::

    async with BleakTransport(address) as transport:
        client = IgpsportClient(transport)
        await client.start()
        ...

Leaving the context manager disconnects the BLE link and cancels any
pending writes. The transport is not safe to reuse after close.
