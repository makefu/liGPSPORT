"""Tests for BleakTransport's MTU-fragment reassembly logic.

We don't have a real BLE adapter in the test environment, but the
reassembly loop is pure-Python and can be exercised by feeding it
notification chunks directly. The point is to catch off-by-one and
header-skew bugs before they manifest as silent corruption in the
field.
